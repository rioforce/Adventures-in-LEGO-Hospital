"Adventures in LEGO Hospital" Storyline

Based on Dr. Clickitt's line in LEGO Island: "We're so busy, we should have our own title, 'Adventures in the LEGO Hospital!'"

The player is Dr. Clickitt. Dr. Clickitt has to play through 2 floors of LEGO Hospital. The game is a obstacle course. You must fight your way through floors of patients, LEGO blocks, parrots, umbrella-dropping ambulances, and skeletons!

The boss in the game is the common cold! Doctor must fight it by going around the cold, grabbing the syringe from Return and Enter, then vacinating the common cold!

============
My name: Clickitt. My mission: traverse the chaos known as the LEGO Hospital, and rescue my patients from the horrors of their personal terrors known as allergies, sickness, and even smashing. My tools: Whits, common sense, and practice-- wait! Why should I practice? I don't need to practice! Iâ€˜m a doctor, for goodness sake!



Strategy
----------

You play through, jumping over things, ducking under things, and hopping around things. To get around some things, you will have to change them to get them out of your way. Such as:

A hospital bed is in the path, and its got a patient in it, and it has some tubes connected to the patient. You have to click the bed or stand with tubes, and it will change to something else useful.

To defeat a skeleton you can click on a skeleton and it turns into a puppy. 



Ideas
------

In waiting room, heads of all minifigs track to the character. 

Enter's head falls off in beginning cutscene as a hint. On level 2, if you click on Dr. Bones, he will pull out Enter's head from behind a curtain and you might win a game.

Elevator scene:

Shows inside of elevator with four buttons: roof, level 2, level 1, basement. Click basement and it shows a video of Nick swimming.

Boss:

Common cold. Clickitt has shot thingy and jabs the cold and it is gone.
