===========================

My name: Clickitt. 

My mission: traverse the chaos known as the LEGO Hospital, and rescue my patients 

from the horrors of their personal terrors known as allergies, sickness, and even smashing. 

My tools: Whits, common sense, and practice-- wait! Why should I practice? I don't need to practice! Iâ€˜m a doctor, for goodness sake!
